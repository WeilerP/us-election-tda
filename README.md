## Getting started

__1. Linux / MacOS__

If you have `pip` installed, it suffices to run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3.7 env
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install python-igraph
```

__2. Windows__

You first have to download from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-igraph) the binary wheel corresponding to your Python version and architecture. Then, you need to run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3.7 env
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install python_igraph‑0.7.1.post6‑cp{YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION}‑cp{YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION}‑win_amd64.whl
```
